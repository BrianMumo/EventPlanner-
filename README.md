## Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher recommended)
- **Git** (optional, for version control)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrianMumo/EventPlanner-.git
   cd EventPlanner
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   In the project directory, install the required dependencies with:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up JSON Server**

   JSON Server is used to simulate a backend for event data.

   - Create a `db.json` file in the root directory and populate it with sample event data, like so:

     ```json
     {
       "events": [
         {
           "id": 1,
           "title": "Team Meeting",
           "date": "2024-11-15",
           "time": "10:00 AM",
           "location": "Office A",
           "description": "Quarterly team meeting."
         },
         {
           "id": 2,
           "title": "Product Launch",
           "date": "2024-12-01",
           "time": "2:00 PM",
           "location": "Main Hall",
           "description": "Launch event for the new product line."
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

   - Start JSON Server (using port 3001):
     ```bash
     npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
     ```

4. **Run the App**

   In another terminal window, start the React app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Your app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` with JSON Server providing data at `http://localhost:3001/events`.
